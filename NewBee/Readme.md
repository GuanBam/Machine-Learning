# This Project
This Project is something I learned from the book "Machine Learning In Action", and partial of my understaning.
I afford the code with my comments, also I modified the code a little bit to make it work for Python 3.7.4

Most things in this project reference to this book.
You can download the source code from the website for free. *(Note:The Source Code are written in Python 2)*

Please buy the book to support his work if you find anything useful in this project.

In the book, there are more details about how the author desiged the codes and the logic about those algorithms.
Also, there're more examples about how the algorithm works and why some processes are necessary.
